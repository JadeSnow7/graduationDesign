This thesis addresses the complex knowledge structure, abstract concepts, and high Q\&A workload in the course Electromagnetics and Electromagnetic Waves. It focuses on knowledge graph construction, a large language model (LLM) and knowledge graph collaborative QA engine, system prototyping, and testing. The system adopts an embedded H5 front end in WeCom or a web interface and a layered architecture with a Vue client, a Go/Gin backend, and an AI service. The backend provides unified authentication and RBAC. The knowledge graph is built by extracting, merging, and structuring course materials to organize concepts, formulas, and theorems for retrieval. The collaborative QA engine introduces GraphRAG-based retrieval augmentation, calling the LLM with graph-structured context to explain concepts, interpret formulas, and guide problem solving, while controllable prompting improves reliability and traceability. The prototype completes knowledge index construction, QA interaction, and WeCom/web integration, and outlines testing and evaluation for functionality, accuracy, and performance.
